# What now?
You sit down at your desktop. Your desktop is currently blank.
You reminisce back to 1999, when your friend emailed you about a new, hip, cool program called ~REDACTED~. It was a social little monkey to put on your desktop, and he told you beaver jokes, would mock you while you worked, and tell one out of 5 facts.

That's right, he's coming back.

This time, stronger than before.

And also cross-platform.
